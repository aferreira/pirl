		[Thanks, Andreas, for spotting that]
		http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40157

0.0017  Sun Mar 09 12:00:00 2008
	- assume this is not supposed to work for Perls
		under 5.6.0
	- cope with noisy 5.6 blib at t/20expect_quit.t
		(illustrated by test report http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/03/msg1099937.html)
	- pirl now accepts switches --version and -v
	- added IPC::Cmd and Test::Deep as prerequisites
		for testing

0.0016  Mon Mar 03 12:00:00 2008
	- quit is now a method
	- history is now persistent across sections
		(should work with T::RL::Gnu and T::RL::Perl)
	- new dependencies: File::HomeDir, Path::Class,
		and File::Slurp

0.0015  Fri Jul 27 12:00:00 2007
	- fixed 'quit'
	- the first of the Expect tests: t/20expect_quit.t
	- pirl now accepts switches --ornaments and --noornaments

0.0014  Thu Jul 26 12:00:00 2007
	- Shell::Perl now prints to the output stream of the
		associated term
	- new test t/10compile.t
	- :x is the same as :exit, :quit, :q
	- quit is an alias to "sub { exit }" in the sandbox package

0.0013  Thu Jun 21 12:00:00 2007
	- the dumpers now deparse Perl code
	- added new dumper based on Data::Dump::Streamer,
		no docs by now (try it with ":set out DDS")

0.0012  Thu Jun 21 12:00:00 2007
	- added an experimental "dump history" command
		(RT #26973, by mgrimes)
	- hopefully get rid of the double newline in eval output

0.0011  Thu Jun 21 12:00:00 2007
	- some minor improvements to Makefile.PL - conformance
		to META.yml specification
	- when dumping YAML, prefer YAML::Syck to YAML if available
	- we have a bug to fix: the REPL and the running interpreter
		share global state (like $_) and so relying on these
		between lines is not nice (to say the least)

0.0010  Wed Mar 14 12:00:00 2007
	- this is a read-eval-print loop and not a
		read-eval-loop, doh
	- total rewrite for the implementation of dumpers
	- new output style with the plain dumper (idea
		borrowed from Sepia by Sean O'Rourke)
	- Data::Dump, Data::Dumper, YAML are only required
		at runtime and fail gracefully if not there
	- the preferred dumper is via Data::Dump, but it
		falls back to Data::Dumper, YAML and the plain
		dumper according to availability
	- fix bug: inline contexts (like #scalar)
		were not being respected for printing
	- Makefile.PL required ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.31
		and we are more tolerant now (thanks, Lorn)
	- now the right line number is used at
		warnings and errors (Lorn again)

0.0009  Tue Mar 13 12:00:00 2007
	- forgot README in MANIFEST
	- the default evaluation package is now

	- sources imported to Google code (no history :(, yet)
	- patches by cmarcelo:

	- we have tests now, even though t/98pod-coverage.t
		does not pass yet
