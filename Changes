Revision history for Perl extension Shell::Perl.

0.0020  Mar 10, 2011
        - no real change
        - Test fixes for keeping 5.6 happy

0.0019  Mar 9, 2011
        - Dumper updated to work with Data::Dump 1.16+

0.0018  Oct 25, 2008
        - fix t/11version.t to deal with IPC::Cmd $err
          as an error message (undef on success) rather
          than an error code (0 on success)
          [Thanks, Andreas, for spotting that]

0.0017  Mar  9, 2008
        - assume this is not supposed to work for Perls
          under 5.6.0
        - cope with noisy 5.6 blib at t/20expect_quit.t
          (illustrated by test report http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/03/msg1099937.html)
        - pirl now accepts switches --version and -v 
        - added IPC::Cmd and Test::Deep as prerequisites 
          for testing

0.0016  Mar  3, 2008
        - quit is now a method
        - history is now persistent across sections
          (should work with T::RL::Gnu and T::RL::Perl)
        - new dependencies: File::HomeDir, Path::Class,
          and File::Slurp

0.0015  Jul 27, 2007
        - fixed 'quit'
        - the first of the Expect tests: t/20expect_quit.t
        - pirl now accepts switches --ornaments and --noornaments

0.0014  Jul 26, 2007
        - Shell::Perl now prints to the output stream of the
          associated term
        - new test t/10compile.t
        - :x is the same as :exit, :quit, :q
        - quit is an alias to "sub { exit }" in the sandbox package

0.0013  Jun 21, 2007
        - the dumpers now deparse Perl code
        - added new dumper based on Data::Dump::Streamer,
          no docs by now (try it with ":set out DDS")

0.0012  Jun 21, 2007
        - added an experimental "dump history" command 
          (RT #26973, by mgrimes)
        - hopefully get rid of the double newline in eval output

0.0011  Jun 21, 2007 [worked around Mar 15, 2007]
        - some minor improvements to Makefile.PL - conformance
          to META.yml specification
        - when dumping YAML, prefer YAML::Syck to YAML if available
        - we have a bug to fix: the REPL and the running interpreter
          share global state (like $_) and so relying on these
          between lines is not nice (to say the least)

0.0010  Mar 14, 2007
        - this is a read-eval-print loop and not a
          read-eval-loop, doh
        - total rewrite for the implementation of dumpers
        - new output style with the plain dumper (idea
          borrowed from Sepia by Sean O'Rourke)
        - Data::Dump, Data::Dumper, YAML are only required
          at runtime and fail gracefully if not there
        - the preferred dumper is via Data::Dump, but it
          falls back to Data::Dumper, YAML and the plain
          dumper according to availability
        - fix bug: inline contexts (like #scalar)
          were not being respected for printing
        - Makefile.PL required ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.31 
          and we are more tolerant now (thanks, Lorn)
        - now the right line number is used at
          warnings and errors (Lorn again)

0.0009  Mar 13, 2007
        - forgot README in MANIFEST
        - the default evaluation package is now
          "Shell::Perl::sandbox"

0.0008  Mar 13, 2007
        - cmarcelo: some doc typos fixed
        - a SEE ALSO section
        - first CPAN release

0.0007  Mar 7, 2007
        - added some POD to Shell.pm and pirl source files

0.0006  Feb 23, 2007
        - sources imported to Google code (no history :(, yet)
        - patches by cmarcelo:
          * implement list and void contexts for evaluation
          * implement context override in a per-input basis
        - we have tests now, even though t/98pod-coverage.t
          does not pass yet

0.0005  Jan 27, 2007
        - relax the restrictions during eval - no strict qw(vars subs)
